New features:
- Added four unused emotes (yes, no, eat, scared) that were left over from the original game but were never unused (NOTE THAT WE CANNOT FIX BROKEN EMOTES, THESE FOUR ARENT SUPPORTED BY ALL AVATARS)
- Implemented like rewards for twiggle builders (credits to sweetfox for implementing this)

Fixes:
- Fixed online player counter on the API website (credits to sweetfox for patching this)
- Fixed the emote wheel not showing all emotes [WIP]
- Fixed server error loop when players change while retrieving the player list [WIP]
- Fixed duplicate lockpick consumption when hitting the lock rings [WIP]
