New features:
- Implemented voice chat
- Added four unused emotes (/yes, /no, /eat, /scared) that were left over from the original game but were never unused (NOTE THAT WE CANNOT FIX BROKEN EMOTES, THESE FOUR ARENT SUPPORTED BY ALL AVATARS)

Fixes:

HEADS-UP!
Centuria/EmuFeral now has a room management system! This means you will not always be in the same room as other players!
Use the social system to get to other players if you arent in the same room as them. The server prioritizes rooms with followed players over other rooms unless they are 'full',
but you can always teleport to your friends.
