New quests:


Fixes in the server:

- Fixed duplicate lockpick consumption when hitting the lock rings
- Fixed date/time formatting issues that were causing time desyncs
- Improved chat performance by overhaulling sendmessage handling, the room system and general networking logic
- Properly implemented trade chat, its no longer a DM channel but a transient channel thats closed when trade ends
- Fixed the moderation log not showing the chat message when autofilter mutes players
- Fixed find player crashing the game when the target player has not used the social services before
- Fixed player actions (sitting etc) not correctly syncing when using the editor
- Fixed player card, display names and experience server calls randomly failing
- Fixed quest item randomization breaking down causing eg. feed the tree to bug out
- Fixed harvest trackers progressing the quest while its not started
- Fixed issues with the block system in chat
- Fixed initial sync coordinates being off

Fixes in the client:
- Fixed chat randomly failing to connect at world join [WIP, only need new protocol]
- Fixed chart patches not being picked up by all of the game
- Fixed chart patches not being correctly parsed, fixed new chart definitions not working
- Fixed the emote wheel not showing all of the primary emotes (note that the new four emotes
- Fixed autologin errors preventing further regular loginsare only usable via slash commands)
- POTENTIALLY fixed the infamous 10-XXX (critical error updating feral) bug (unable to reproduce, theoretical remedy in place, may be resolved but unable to trigger it)
- Fixed login loading screen transition randomly failing to fade in
- Fixed chat stripping <> while noparse takes care of that
- Fixed creation of assets not functioning correctly

Other changes:
- Made it that the Centuria APIs arent blocked by CORS
- Increased the amount of chat messages are saved to history for dms to 500
- Refactored server resources, they are now properly structured
- Added a 'reason' argument to the updateshutdown command
- Added a 'reason' argument to the startmaintenance command
- Increased jump force (a fourth of extra force)
- Dragons can now 'glide' without wings


HEADS-UP!
Centuria/EmuFeral now has a room management system! This means you will not always be in the same room as other players!
Use the social system to get to other players if you arent in the same room as them. The server prioritizes rooms with followed players over other rooms unless they are 'full',
but you can always teleport to your friends.


TODO:

important:
- fix error code 13 -_-
- more quests (and unlock Ultimate Refreshment for the community)
- redo autologin to only log in after reaching login
- if its not too much work, refactor to use strings instead of numeric defids
- if its not too much work, implement more transformer systems for eg avatars and items, and make the server dynamic for items, avis etc instead of hardcoded
- length-prefixed chat and game protocol for feraltweaks
- implement token refreshing via feraltweaks
- allow moderators to fetch the chat log
- make it that chat commands can be passed to the server
- implement downloading of unity assemblies for unstripping
- fix what the hex star frag rewards

important, but later:
- build tools
- forgot password and registration via launcher
- launcher-based password changing (and deprecate old method)
- forgot password API feature
- forgot password in launcher
- password change windows ingame if possible
- allow staff to hide their prefixes

quality:
- fix npc head rotation (another script interferes with it)
- reintroduce dragon elemental breath
- fix avatar sound looping bug

after that:
- a command that shows how many items are placed in the sanctuary
- a command to skip quest objectives

just before update release:
- add icons for the installer warning decree, the 1.7.1 decree and the android decree
- implement a proxy-based encryption layer in the android client for game server encryption
- add discord RPC to the launcher base package
- enable gameserver encryption on LIVE
- enable director encryption on LIVE
- update chart patches on LIVE

somewhere:
- set up bleedingedge channel building (automatic deploy from github actions)
- implement asset-server-based FeralTweaks support in the FeralTweaks server module, this allows applying chart patches to the chart file directly
