Building the Client Mod:

You will need a unhollowed version of the fer.al game assembly (Assembly-CSharp.dll) to build / run the client mod.
The hollowed version of the fer.al assembly is generated by the BepinEX client when first ran, in "client\build\BepInEx\unhollowed".
Place it into the "clientmods\org.asf.centuria.client.plugin\lib\feral" in this repository to be able to build the client mod.

I have plans to write the plugin to be able to self-retrieve the assembly when ran.
But in order to build it, you MUST manually obtain and move the fer.al game assembly.
